## Do quick statusbar blanking.  Statusbar messages will disappear after
## 1 keystroke instead of 26.  Note that "const" overrides this.
##
# set quickblank

## The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs.
## This is an extended regular expression if your system supports them,
## otherwise a literal string.  Default:
# set quotestr "^([ 	]*[#:>\|}])+"
## if you have extended regular expression support, otherwise:
# set quotestr "> "

## Fix Backspace/Delete confusion problem.
# set rebinddelete

## Fix numeric keypad key confusion problem.
# set rebindkeypad

## Do extended regular expression searches by default.
# set regexp

## Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at the
## very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor
## will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the
## cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true
## beginning of the line.
# set smarthome

## Use smooth scrolling as the default.
# set smooth

## Enable soft line wrapping (AKA full line display).
# set softwrap

## Use this spelling checker instead of the internal one.  This option
## does not properly have a default value.
##
# set speller "aspell -x -c"

## Allow nano to be suspended.
# set suspend

## Use this tab size instead of the default; it must be greater than 0.
# set tabsize 8

## Convert typed tabs to spaces.
# set tabstospaces

## Save automatically on exit, don't prompt.
# set tempfile

## Enable the new (EXPERIMENTAL) generic undo code, not just for line
## cuts.
# set undo

## Disallow file modification.  Why would you want this in an rcfile? ;)
# set view

## The two single-column characters used to display the first characters
## of tabs and spaces.  187 in ISO 8859-1 (0000BB in Unicode) and 183 in
## ISO-8859-1 (0000B7 in Unicode) seem to be good values for these.
# set whitespace "  "

## Detect word boundaries more accurately by treating punctuation
## characters as parts of words.
# set wordbounds


## Color setup
##
## Format:
##
## syntax "short description" ["filename regex" ...]
##
## The "none" syntax is reserved; specifying it on the command line is
## the same as not having a syntax at all.  The "default" syntax is
## special: it takes no filename regexes, and applies to files that
## don't match any other syntax's filename regexes.
##
## color foreground,background "regex" ["regex"...]
## or
## icolor foreground,background "regex" ["regex"...]
##
## "color" will do case sensitive matches, while "icolor" will do case
## insensitive matches.
##
## Valid colors: white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, magenta, cyan.
## For foreground colors, you may use the prefix "bright" to get a
## stronger highlight.
##
## To use multi-line regexes, use the start="regex" end="regex"
## [start="regex" end="regex"...] format.
##
## If your system supports transparency, not specifying a background
## color will use a transparent color.  If you don't want this, be sure
## to set the background color to black or white.
##
## If you wish, you may put your syntaxes in separate files.  You can
## make use of such files (which can only include "syntax", "color", and
## "icolor" commands) as follows:
##
## include "/path/to/syntax_file.nanorc"
##
## Unless otherwise noted, the name of the syntax file (without the
## ".nanorc" extension) should be the same as the "short description"
## name inside that file.  These names are kept fairly short to make
## them easier to remember and faster to type using nano's -Y option.
##
## All regexes should be extended regular expressions.

## Key bindings
## Please see nanorc(5) for more details on this
##
## Here are some samples to get you going
##
# bind M-W nowrap main
# bind M-A casesens search
# bind ^S research main

## Set this if your backspace key sends delete most of the time (2.1.3+)
# bind kdel backspace all
